= Test 6 - Link-a-palooza (all three link options altered)

Make sure combos of link options work.

Use a visual selection (e.g. `vee`) to highlight the words "foo bar" below
and then hit Enter to create a multi-word link. Hit Enter again to navigate
to the link. It should attempt to open a file named "foo bar.adoc".

Link to foo bar should work.  <-- Create `foo bar` link here.

The created link should look like this: `<<foo bar.adoc#,foo bar>>`
