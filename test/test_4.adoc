= Test 4 - Visual link creation

Use a visual selection (e.g. `vee`) to highlight the words "foo bar" below
and then hit Enter to create a multi-word link. Hit Enter again to navigate
to the link. It should attempt to open a file named "foo bar.adoc".

Link to foo bar should work.  <-- Create `foo bar` link here.
