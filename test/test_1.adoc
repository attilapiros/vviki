= Test 1 - Instructions and basic links

Welcome to the first test document.

== Test basic linking

Make sure this link looks like `Foo` and `link:foo[Foo]` depending on whether
or not your cursor is on the line. Enter should take you to the Foo page.

link:foo[Foo]  <-- Test this link.


== Test script

Every test document also has a script which sets up the environment for that
particular test. In this case, we're just going with the defaults, so there's
not much going on in this one:

----
Test Script Start
echo "Hello! This test uses defaults, so there's nothing to do here."
Test Script End
----


== Test controls

To navigate, use the following keyboard shortcuts:

`F5`     Reloads the test (very useful for debugging)
`Right`  Load the next test
`Left`   Load the previous test
