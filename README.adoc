== Vw Lite

At the moment this is "Vimwiki Lite". Just the features of VimWiki I actually use.

=== Features

Enter creates link, then follows link.

Backspace goes 'back'.

=== Why?

AsciiDoc support - syntax highlighting separated from wiki functionality.

Tiny, easy to modify.

Fun to make.

=== Quick Dev

This has been awesome.  F4 opens a test wiki and the plugin and sources it.  Then F5 sources the plugin again and swaps back and forth between the wiki and plugin in splits.  Love it.

let g:vimwiki_lite_root = "~/vwlite"
let g:vimwiki_lite_ext  = ".adoc"
" Quick development: hit F5 to save, source, and jump to split window
function! Devthis()
	let l:pluginsrc = '~/d/proj/vwlite/vwlite.vim'
	exe "nnoremap <F5> :w\<cr>:so ".l:pluginsrc."\<cr>\<C-w>\<C-w>"
	exe "so ".l:pluginsrc
	exe "edit ".l:pluginsrc
	exe "split ".g:vimwiki_lite_root."/index.adoc"
endfunction

" Setup dev environment for vw lite plugin
nnoremap <F4> :call Devthis()<cr>
