1. Introduction                                           *vviki-introduction*

VViki provides "wiki-like" functionality for Vim. It aims to make creating
linked 'pages' of content as painless as possible by providing simple keyboard
mappings to link pages, create new pages, and navigate between pages.

VViki was inspired by VimWiki (and shares many of the same mappings).

VViki uses AsciiDoc syntax because that is what the author prefers (AsciiDoc is
lightweight and readable like Markdown, but has the expressive power of DocBook
- a markup language intended for authoring technical documentation.) VViki uses
Vim's existing AsciiDoc syntax highlighting (or you are free to substitute any
other AsciiDoc syntax highlighter - or none at all).

VViki is excellent for:

 * Technical documentation
 * Mind-mapping
 * Note-taking
 * Diary entries
 * Website authoring

VViki is ready for your great content now!


==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                         *vviki-usage*

There is plentiful information about AsciiDoc syntax available on the Web.
Much of the basic formatting is very similar to Markdown.

The most important thing to understand is the link "macro" syntax:

>
	link:http://example.com[Example]   external
	link:page[My Page]                 internal
	link:/page[My Page]                internal absolute path
	link:../page[My Page]              internal relative path
<

It's a little verbose, and that's where VViki's link mapping comes in quite
handy |vviki-enter|.

3. Mappings                                                   *vviki-mappings*

VViki has no global mappings.  When a new wiki page is detected, the following
mappings are available:

<CR>         |vviki-enter| Create/follow link under cursor.

<Backspace>  |vviki-back| Return to previous page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 *vviki-enter*

When you press Return/Enter on a normal piece of text, VViki will turn the
text into a link using the WORD (sequence of non-blank characters under the
cursor). `my_page` becomes `link:my_page[my_page]`.

Pressing Return/Enter on an existing internal (wiki) link will open that page
for editing. (New pages will be created.)

NOTE: At this time, VViki doesn't create directories. You may want to create
subdirectories before editing pages within them.

Pressing Return/Enter on an external (Web) link will attempt to open the URL
using the `xdg-open` application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  *vviki-back*

VViki keeps a history of visited wiki pages. Pressing Backspace in normal mode
visits the previously visited page and the page before that until you run out
of history.

==============================================================================
4. Configuration                                         *vviki-configuration*

TODO: flesh this out
At the moment, VViki has two settings.

>
    let g:vviki_root = "~/wiki"
    let g:vviki_ext  = ".adoc"
<

You'll probably also want to add a shortcut to open your wiki. The easier it
is to get to the wiki, the more likely you are to use it as needed.

This mimics VimWiki's mapping to open the wiki index:

nnoremap <leader>ww :e ~/wiki/index.adoc<cr>

Tip: consider creating other mappings to J open other wiki pages you use
frequently!
